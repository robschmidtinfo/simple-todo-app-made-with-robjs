# Simple Todo App made with RobJS 
This serves as an example for an app that is entirely made with the JavaScript Frontend Framework [RobJS](https://github.com/robschmidtinfo/robjs).<br/>
(Except for styling where Bootstrap5 was used.)<br/><br/>
Additionally to the documentation of the repository of [RobJS](https://github.com/robschmidtinfo/robjs), this is a very good way to get your hands dirty with the framework.<br/><br/>

Check out the working app [here](https://robschmidtinfo.github.io/simple-todo-app-made-with-robjs/).
